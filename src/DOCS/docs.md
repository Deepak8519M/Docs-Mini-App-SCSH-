Great question! Let's clarify why **Tailwind CSS** is listed in the `devDependencies` instead of `dependencies` in your `package.json`.

---

### ✅ **Quick Definitions**

| Field               | Used For                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"dependencies"`    | Packages required **at runtime** (in production).                                    |
| `"devDependencies"` | Packages only needed **during development** (e.g., build tools, linters, compilers). |

---

### 🎯 So why is **Tailwind CSS** in `devDependencies`?

Because Tailwind is a **build-time CSS framework**. It doesn’t get shipped **directly to the browser** as a runtime library like React does.

#### Specifically:

- It processes your source files (HTML/JSX/TSX/etc.) during the build.
- It generates the final CSS file from your class names.
- Once built, your final app **does not need Tailwind itself** — just the generated CSS.

---

### 🧠 Therefore:

```json
"tailwindcss": "^3.4.17"
```

is in:

```json
"devDependencies"
```

👉 Because it’s **only needed to build the final CSS**, not to **run your app** in production.

---

### 📦 On the other hand:

```json
"react": "^19.1.0",
"react-dom": "^19.1.0"
```

These go in `"dependencies"` because they’re needed **at runtime**, in the actual React app running in the browser.

---

### ✅ Summary:

| Package              | devDependencies? | dependencies? | Why?                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `tailwindcss`        | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No         | Needed during development/build only |
| `react`, `react-dom` | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes        | Needed during runtime in browser     |

---

In **Tailwind CSS**, you can control font weight using the `font-` utilities.

Here's how to **define font weight** in Tailwind:

---

### ✅ Basic Syntax

```html
class="font-normal"
```

---

### ✅ Available Font Weights in Tailwind CSS

| Class             | Weight | Description      |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| `font-thin`       | 100    | Very thin        |
| `font-extralight` | 200    | Extra light      |
| `font-light`      | 300    | Light            |
| `font-normal`     | 400    | Normal (default) |
| `font-medium`     | 500    | Medium           |
| `font-semibold`   | 600    | Semi bold        |
| `font-bold`       | 700    | Bold             |
| `font-extrabold`  | 800    | Extra bold       |
| `font-black`      | 900    | Heaviest (black) |

---

### ✅ Example Usage

```html
<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Heading</h1>
<p class="text-base font-light">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

---

### ✅ Custom Fonts (Like Poppins)

If you're using a custom font like **Poppins**, you can still apply `font-bold`, `font-light`, etc., as long as those weights are imported from Google Fonts.

> 💡 **Make sure to import the font weights you want.**
> For example, in Google Fonts:

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

---

You're getting this error because in **PostCSS** (which Tailwind uses under the hood), **`@import` statements must come first**—**before any other CSS rules or Tailwind directives (except `@charset` or `@layer`)**.

---

### 🔴 Your Current Code (Incorrect Order)

```css
@tailwind utilities;

@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Urbanist:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap");

* {
  margin: 0;
}
```

---

### ✅ Fix: Move `@import` to the Top

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Urbanist:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap");

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

* {
  margin: 0;
}
```

> ✅ Rule: `@import` must go at the top of the file, before any Tailwind or CSS code.

---

### 💡 Bonus Tip: Use Font in Tailwind

In your `tailwind.config.js`, add the font:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
export default {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        urbanist: ["Urbanist", "sans-serif"],
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Then use it like:

```html
<h1 class="font-urbanist font-bold text-3xl">Hello!</h1>
```

---

Great question! Let's break down **why your centered `Docs.` text doesn't appear to resize when you zoom in or out**.

---

### 🔍 Here's your code for the heading:

```jsx
<h1 className="text-zinc-900 text-[13vw] leading-none tracking-normal font-semibold absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-[50%] -translate-y-[50%]">
  Docs.
</h1>
```

---

### ✅ 1. `text-[13vw]` — What it means

- This sets the **font size** based on the **viewport width** (`vw` = viewport width).
- `13vw` means: the text will always be **13% of the total browser width**.
- This **makes it responsive to the screen size**, **not** to browser **zoom**.

---

### ❓ So why doesn’t it resize with zoom?

When you zoom in/out using the browser:

- The **viewport width remains the same** in CSS `vw` units.
- The browser visually scales **everything**, not just text.
- But `vw`-based sizes **don’t adjust like `rem`, `em`, or `px`** when zooming.

That’s why:

- The `Docs.` heading **looks like it's not changing** on zoom (it is technically being scaled visually by the browser zoom, but since it’s tied to the viewport, it doesn’t “grow” the way you expect).

---

### ✅ How to fix if you want it to respond to zoom

Use **relative units** like `rem` or `em` instead of `vw`:

```jsx
<h1 className="text-zinc-900 text-[6rem] leading-none tracking-normal font-semibold absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-[50%] -translate-y-[50%]">
  Docs.
</h1>
```

Or, you can combine responsiveness and accessibility:

```jsx
<h1 className="text-zinc-900 text-7xl md:text-8xl lg:text-9xl font-semibold absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-[50%] -translate-y-[50%]">
  Docs.
</h1>
```

> ✅ This way, it will scale with zoom **and** screen size.

---

### 💡 Summary:

- `vw` is tied to screen width, not zoom level.
- Use `rem`, `em`, or Tailwind’s responsive font sizes (`text-5xl`, `text-7xl`, etc.) for better zoom behavior.

---

No worries! Let's explain it **step-by-step** in a super simple way with visuals in your mind.

---

### 🔴 Problem you saw:

You wrote:

```jsx
<div className="w-full h-screen fixed z-[3] bg-sky-800"></div>
```

And you asked:

> "Why does it show at the top, not in the place I wrote it?"

---

### ✅ First, what does `fixed` do?

> Imagine you are **sticking a paper to your screen** — no matter where you scroll, it stays **fixed** to the screen.

So, if you don't tell it **where** to stick (top, bottom, etc.), it will go to the **default: top-left corner**.

---

### ✅ So in Tailwind, this code:

```jsx
<div className="fixed w-full h-screen bg-sky-800"></div>
```

👆 Means:

- Take up full width and height of the screen
- Stick to the **top-left** (default behavior of `fixed`)
- So it appears **at the top**

---

### 💡 Solution: You must tell it **where to go**

#### ✅ If you want it to fully cover the screen:

```jsx
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-[3] bg-sky-800"></div>
```

**`inset-0`** is a shortcut in Tailwind.
It means:

```css
top: 0;
left: 0;
right: 0;
bottom: 0;
```

So now your element **fully covers** the screen from all sides.

---

### 🧠 Easy Visual Comparison

| Code                 | What Happens                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `fixed` only         | Goes to **top-left** corner (default)     |
| `fixed top-0 left-0` | Same as above, but **explicitly** placing |
| `fixed inset-0`      | Fills the **entire screen**               |

---

### ✍️ Fix for your code:

Update this:

```jsx
<div className="w-full h-screen fixed z-[3] bg-sky-800"></div>
```

To this:

```jsx
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-[3] bg-sky-800"></div>
```

Now it will perfectly cover the screen in the right place!

---

Great! You're now using the `Background` component and trying to understand how it works and **why you're seeing the content the way it is**. Let's go **step-by-step** and break down every line in detail using **visuals in your mind**.

---

## ✅ Full Breakdown of Your `Background` Component:

```jsx
function Background() {
  return (
    <>
      <div className="w-full h-screen fixed z-2">
```

### 1. `w-full h-screen fixed z-2`

- ✅ `w-full` → Make the container as wide as the full screen.
- ✅ `h-screen` → Make it as tall as the full screen (100vh).
- ✅ `fixed` → This element is **glued to the screen**, not affected by scrolling or parent positioning.
- ✅ `z-2` → It's placed in **layer z-index 2**, so it sits _above_ `z-1` and _below_ `z-3`.

**🧠 Think of it like a transparent glass pane covering the screen and holding text on top.**

---

```jsx
<div className="w-full py-7 flex justify-center text-zinc-500 text-xl font-semibold absolute top-[5%]">
  Documents.
</div>
```

### 2. Header Text: `"Documents."`

- ✅ `w-full` → Span full width.
- ✅ `py-7` → Adds vertical padding.
- ✅ `flex justify-center` → Center the text **horizontally**.
- ✅ `absolute top-[5%]` → Place it **5% down from the top** of the screen.
- ✅ `text-zinc-500 text-xl font-semibold` → Styles the font (gray, large, semi-bold).

> 🧠 Visually: Imagine a label _"Documents."_ gently floating at the top center of your screen.

---

```jsx
<h1 className="text-zinc-900 text-[13vw] leading-none tracking-normal font-semibold absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-[50%] -translate-y-[50%]">
  Docs.
</h1>
```

### 3. Big Center Text: `"Docs."`

- ✅ `text-[13vw]` → Super responsive text size based on **13% of screen width**.
- ✅ `absolute top-1/2 left-1/2` → Position the top-left of the element at **50% from top and left**.
- ✅ `-translate-x-[50%] -translate-y-[50%]` → Shifts the element left and up by 50% of its own size.
- ✅ Combined → This **perfectly centers** the text in the middle of the screen.
- ✅ `text-zinc-900 font-semibold` → Styles it as dark gray and bold.

> 🧠 Visually: A big, central **“Docs.”** is stuck right in the middle of your screen, no matter the size.

---

### ⚠️ Why `fixed` is important here:

- It **detaches** this background layer from the rest of your app.
- Keeps it **always full-screen**, even if other components move or scroll.
- You can place another element like a `div` with `fixed z-[3]` on top of this to create a layer above it.

---

### ✅ Visualization Summary

```
------------------------------------------
|                                        |
|      "Documents."   ← top 5%          |
|                                        |
|                                        |
|           Docs.   ← centered          |
|                                        |
|                                        |
------------------------------------------
(Whole screen is a fixed, layered pane)
```

---

### 🧠 TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read)

- Your `Background` component creates a **full-screen fixed layer**.
- It shows `"Documents."` near the top and `"Docs."` perfectly centered.
- You used `fixed` + `absolute` positioning with transforms to **layer and center elements precisely**.
- This is useful when building **landing pages, hero sections, or layered UIs**.

---

Great follow-up question:

> **"Will `absolute` work along with `fixed`?"**

### ✅ Short Answer:

**Yes**, `absolute` **does** work inside a `fixed` element — and it works exactly as expected!

---

### 🔍 Here’s how it behaves:

#### If you have this:

```jsx
<div className="fixed w-full h-screen">
  <div className="absolute top-1/2 left-1/2">Hello</div>
</div>
```

### ✅ What happens:

- `fixed` is applied to the **parent** element. It sticks to the screen (not affected by scroll).
- `absolute` is applied to the **child**.
- The `absolute` child positions **relative to the nearest non-static parent**, which is the `fixed` div here.

---

### 🔁 In short:

| Parent             | Child Position Type | Child Positions Relative To |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `static` (default) | `absolute`          | Browser viewport            |
| `relative`         | `absolute`          | That parent                 |
| `fixed`            | `absolute`          | That fixed parent           |

---

### 🧠 Example in Tailwind:

```jsx
<div className="fixed w-full h-screen bg-zinc-800">
  <div className="absolute top-10 left-10 text-white">
    I am inside a fixed parent!
  </div>
</div>
```

This will show the text `"I am inside a fixed parent!"` **10px from top and left of the fixed parent**, not the entire window.

---

### ✅ Use Case in Your Project

In your `Background` component:

```jsx
<div className="fixed w-full h-screen z-2">
  <div className="absolute top-[5%]">Documents.</div>
  <h1 className="absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2">
    Docs.
  </h1>
</div>
```

- This is **perfect usage**.
- You use `fixed` to **lock the background** to the screen.
- Then use `absolute` to **place elements precisely** inside that locked background.
