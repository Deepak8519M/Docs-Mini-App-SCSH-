# 📇 Card Dashboard with Animated Form

A modern React application featuring a dynamic card dashboard with an animated form for adding new cards. Built with **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

---

## 📖 Overview

This project is a React-based web application that displays a collection of cards in a responsive grid layout. Users can add new cards via a pop-up form that animates into view with a "popping" effect, powered by **Framer Motion**. The form allows users to input card details such as:

- Description
- File size
- Status (close)
- Tag title
- Tag color
- Visibility (`isOpen`)

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎴 **Dynamic Card Display**: Renders a grid of cards with customizable properties.
- 🎬 **Animated Form**: Pop-in/out form using Framer Motion (fade, scale, and slide).
- 🧾 **Interactive Form**: Add new cards via text input and select dropdowns.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Clean layout styled with Tailwind CSS.
- 🧠 **State Management**: Uses `useState` and `useRef` for form and card handling.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **React** (v18 or higher)
- A modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

## 🧑‍🏫 Interact with the Dashboard

### View Cards

The dashboard displays a grid of cards with properties like:

* Description
* File size
* Status (`close`)
* Tags

### Open Form

Click the **floating plus (+) button** in the bottom-right corner.

### Add a Card

Fill in the form fields:

* **Description**: A short card description.
* **File Size**: e.g., `.9mb`
* **Tag Title**: e.g., `Download Now`
* **Status (`close`)**: Select `True` or `False`
* **Tag Color**: e.g., `Green`, `Blue`
* **Visibility (`isOpen`)**: Select `True` or `False`

Click **Submit** to add the card.

Click **X** to close the form without submitting.

---

## 🎥 Animation

The form uses Framer Motion:

* **Entrance**:

  * Opacity: 0 → 1
  * Scale: 0.8 → 1
  * Y-offset: 20 → 0
* **Exit**: Reverses the entrance animation
* **Duration**: 0.3s with `easeOut`

---

## 🧾 Example Card Data

```json
{
  "desc": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing.",
  "fileSize": ".9mb",
  "close": true,
  "tag": {
    "isOpen": true,
    "tagTitle": "Download Now",
    "tagColor": "green"
  }
}
```

---

## 🧩 Customization

### 🔧 Animation

Modify animation in `Foreground.jsx`:

```js
initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.5, y: 30 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1, y: 0 }}
exit={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.5, y: 30 }}
transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 20 }}
```

Use spring for a bounce effect.

### 🎨 Styling

Change Tailwind classes or add custom styles in `index.css`.

E.g., `backdrop-blur-sm` for frosted glass.

### ➕ Add More Fields

Add additional fields to `formData` and update the form accordingly.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### 🧱 Form Not Clickable?

* Ensure the form has `z-[10]` or higher.
* Inspect layout with DevTools (F12) for overlaps.

### 💥 Animation Issues?

* Verify `framer-motion` is installed
* Check console for errors

### ❌ Card Not Rendering?

* Confirm `Card.jsx` accepts `data` and `reference` props
* Double-check your `map()` loop and `key`

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add animations for newly added cards
* Implement form validation
* Enable drag-and-drop functionality
* Store cards in `localStorage` or connect to backend API
